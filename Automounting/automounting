						Automounting
Automounting is a procedure to automatically mount a filesystem on linux system when the system boots up.
Linux file system maintains a special file /etc/fstab which contain info about filesystem and where to mount which partition during bootup.
/etc/fstab is also important because it is refered by commands fsck,mount, umount commond during their operation.

The structure of /etc/fstab is as follows-
<file_system>   <mount_point>   <type>  <options>     <dump>  <pass>  

file_system ->  contains uid or device file which gives info about filesystem.
		we can either use uid or device file but it is preferred to use uid because device file name may change.
		to view UID of filesystem- use command blkid
		to view name of device file name - use command lsblk

mount_point -> where to mount your partition
		eg /media/aditya/label

type -> type of filesystem
	eg. ntfs,ext4,vfat,tmpfs,udf

options -> options
	eg. defaults - Use default settings. Equivalent to rw, suid, dev, exec, auto, nouser, async.
	    auto/noauto	- do/dont mount automatically at boot time (default-auto)
	    ro/rw -mount read-only/mount read-write (default - rw) 
	    suid/nosuid - permit/block the operation as suid and sgid
	    dev/nodev - interupt/dont interrupt char or block special device on filesystem
	    user/nouser - permit any user/permit only root to mount fs
	    sync/async - all i/o should be done sync or async

dump -> unable(1) or disable(0) backing up of parttion

pass ->	decides priority in which fsck check devices/partions for errors at boot time
	fsck - check and repair file system
	eg.
	0 - dont check for errors
	1 - for root systems
	2 - for other partitions
	
eg to automount a ntfs partition
UUID=das33sasd2sddsa2dn	/mnt/aditya/mounted_fs	ntfs-3g	defaults	0	2

>> mount -a
You can use this command, if you want to mount all partitions now which are mentioned in fstab except those which has noauto options.
