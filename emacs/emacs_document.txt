* vim vs emacs

vim is almost always pre-installed. It's usually more useful for small sessions. You open up a file, do a quick edit and quit.
vim is modal, meaning it supports multiple modes like insert mode, command line mode or the graphical mode which gives access to various key sequences making it slightly faster although it's learning curve is a lot steeper.

emacs is not just a text editor. It's also an IDE, a file manager, a terminal emulator, a web browser, a mail client, a news client.
emacs fanboys boot up their OS, open emacs and then forget about the OS itself because everything that they need to do, they can do using emacs.
emacs is like a mini-OS using which one can check their mails, news, rss feeds, browse the web or run shell scripts.
Multitasking is comparatively a lot easier with emacs since it is better at interacting with multiple subprocesses like some time consuming compiling task, running multiple shell scripts and editing some text file alongside.

(setq gnus-select-method
      '(nnimap "gmail"
	       (nnimap-address "imap.gmail.com")  ; it could also be imap.googlemail.com if that's your server.
	       (nnimap-server-port "imaps")
	       (nnimap-stream ssl)))

(setq smtpmail-smtp-service 587
      gnus-ignored-newsgroups "^to\\.\\|^[0-9. ]+\\( \\|$\\)\\|^[\"]\"[#'()]")
